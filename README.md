# Mini Word Clock

## About The Project

This software was designed for use with https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/853880992/miniature-word-clock-set-in-turned-irish and https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274580832614. However, here is a complete and better firmware for any mini word clock using the ESP8266 and MAX7219.

This code includes a WiFi connection manager and Web Interface to change settings.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple one file solution for a mini word clock, all you need is the Arduino IDE and a few libraries that are within the Arduino Library Manager.

You will need an ESP8266 and a MAX7219 for this project to work.


## Usage

When you first run the project the ESP3266 will emmit a WiFi beacon with a captive portal to let you connect it to your own WiFi network. After you have connected, you can access the Web UI from it's local IP Address.
